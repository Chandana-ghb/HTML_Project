            <p>Agra is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Indian state
                of Uttar Pradesh, about 230 kilometres (140 mi) south-east of the national capital Delhi and 330 km west
                of the
                state capital Lucknow. With a population of roughly 1.6 million, Agra is the fourth-most populous city
                in Uttar
                Pradesh and twenty-third most populous city in India.Agra's notable historical period began during
                Sikandar Khan Lodi's reign, but the golden age of the city began with the Mughals in the early 16th
                century. Agra was the foremost city of the Indian subcontinent and the capital of the Mughal Empire
                under Mughal emperors Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan. Under Mughal rule, Agra became a
                centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion, and saw the construction of the Agra Fort, Sikandra
                and Agra's most prized monument, the Taj Mahal, constructed between 1632 and 1648 by Shah Jahan in
                remembrance of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. With the decline of the Mughal empire in the late 18th century,
                the city fell successively first to Marathas and later to the East India Company. After Independence,
                Agra has developed into an industrial town, with a booming tourism industry, along with footwear,
                leather and other manufacturing. The Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The
                city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a monsoon season, and is famous for its Mughlai
                cuisine. Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur; and the
                Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a tourist circuit of Uttar Pradesh, along with Lucknow and Varanasi.</p>
