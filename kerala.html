                    <p>The Kerala backwaters are a unique network of interconnected canals, rivers, lakes, and lagoons
                        that stretch parallel to the Arabian Sea coast. This serene water world is best experienced
                        through a traditional houseboat cruise, known locally as a kettuvallam. As you drift through the
                        backwaters, you'll witness lush paddy fields, swaying coconut palms, and glimpses of daily
                        village life.
