            <p>Meghalaya is a beautiful state in northeastern India, known for its lush green landscapes, heavy
                rainfall, and unique culture. The name "Meghalaya" means "Abode of Clouds" in Sanskrit. The state was
                formed in 1972 and its capital is Shillong, often called the "Scotland of the East" because of its
                scenic beauty and colonial-era charm.

                Meghalaya is famous for its rolling hills, dense forests, waterfalls, and living root bridges,
                especially in areas like Cherrapunji and Mawsynram, which are among the wettest places on Earth. The
                state is home to several indigenous tribes, mainly the Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia, each with their own
                language, customs, and matrilineal society.

                Tourism, agriculture, and handicrafts play a significant role in the stateâ€™s economy. Meghalaya is also
                known for its vibrant festivals, folk music, and clean villages, like Mawlynnong, often referred to as
                Asiaâ€™s cleanest village. With its natural beauty, unique culture, and peaceful environment, Meghalaya is
                one of the most picturesque and culturally rich states in India.
