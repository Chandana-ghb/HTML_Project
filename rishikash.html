            <p>Uttarakhand is a state in northern India, known for its natural beauty, Himalayan mountains, and
                spiritual significance. Often referred to as "Devbhumi" or "Land of the Gods", it is home to many sacred
                Hindu temples and pilgrimage sites. The state was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000, and its capital
                is Dehradun, while Gairsain is the summer capital.

                Uttarakhand is famous for the Char Dham Yatra â€“ Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri â€“ which
                attracts millions of pilgrims each year. The Ganga and Yamuna rivers also originate from the glaciers in
                this region. The state features scenic hill stations like Mussoorie, Nainital, Almora, and Ranikhet.

                Apart from spirituality, Uttarakhand offers opportunities for adventure tourism, including trekking,
                camping, river rafting, and skiing. It is also rich in wildlife and natural reserves, with national
                parks like Jim Corbett (Indiaâ€™s oldest) and Valley of Flowers, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

                Uttarakhand is known for its peaceful environment, clean air, and greenery, making it a popular
                destination for both tourists and spiritual seekers.
