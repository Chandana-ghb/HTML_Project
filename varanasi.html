            <p>Uttar Pradesh (UP) is a state in northern India and the most populous in the country, with over 240
                million people. Its capital is Lucknow, while other major cities include Varanasi, Agra, Kanpur,
                Prayagraj, and Meerut. UP holds immense historical, cultural, and religious significance. It is home to
                ancient cities like Varanasi, considered one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world,
                and Ayodhya and Mathura, the birthplaces of Lord Rama and Lord Krishna respectively. The state is dotted
                with important religious and historical landmarks such as the Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri, Kashi
                Vishwanath Temple, and Sarnath.
                Uttar Pradesh plays a vital role in India's political and cultural landscape. It has produced several
                prominent leaders, including India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. The Ganga and Yamuna rivers
                flow through the state, supporting agriculture and religious life. Festivals like Kumbh Mela, held in
                Prayagraj, attract millions of pilgrims. Economically, UP is driven by agriculture (producing wheat,
                sugarcane, and rice), tourism, handicrafts, and growing industrial sectors. It is also a center for
                education with prestigious institutions like IIT Kanpur, IIM Lucknow, BHU, and AMU. With its rich
                history, spiritual legacy, and evolving infrastructure, Uttar Pradesh remains a cornerstone of India's
                heritage and development.</p>
